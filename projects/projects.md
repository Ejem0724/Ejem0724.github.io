# Projects
Here you can find my recent data analysis projects and their progress.

## Guild Management Database | Blue Ridge CTC | March 2025 | MS Access, SQL, Database management
Designed and developed comprehensive database system to track 50+ guild members, quests, and assignments.
Created advanced queries using SQL to optimize member-quest matching based on skill levels and availability. Implemented
data validation and reporting features for leadership decision-making.

## Cyclistic Data Analysis | Coursera | May 2024 | SQL, Python, Data Visualization
[view this project](./projects/Cyclistic_analysis)\
Conducted comprehensive analysis of 12 months of bike share data (over 2m records) to identify usage patterns
and user behavior differences. Utilized pandas, and matplotlib to discover key insights showing casual riders prefer
weekend recreational trips while annual members use bikes for weekday commuting. Using this information for marketing
focus could increase membership by approximately 35%.
